# CentipedeArcadeGame

Originally created in 2016 for my very basic java programming class CSSE 220. 
This project when run simulates 5 levels of the arcade game centipede, complete with the actual centipede,
but also includes monsters like the scorpion and the spider who appear randomly throughout the game.
